<h2 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why?</a></h2>
<p>The default workflow when using git is having your repository in a single directory.
Then, you can check out a certain reference (usually a branch), which will update
the files in the directory to match the state of that reference. Most of the time,
this is exactly what you need and works perfectly. But especially when you're using
with branches a lot, you may notice that there is a lot of work required to make
everything run smootly.</p>
<p>Maybe you experienced the following: You're working on a feature branch. Then,
for some reason, you have to change branches (maybe to investigate some issue).
But you get the following:</p>
<pre><code>error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can create a temporary commit or stash your changes. In any case, you have
some mental overhead before you can work on something else. Especially with stashes,
you'll have to remember to do a <code>git stash pop</code> before resuming your work (I
cannot count the number of times where is &quot;rediscovered&quot; some code hidden in some
old stash I forgot about.</p>
<p>And even worse: If you're currently in the process of resolving merge conflicts or an
interactive rebase, there is just no way to &quot;pause&quot; this work to check out a
different branch.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it's crucial to have an unchanging state of your repository until some
long-running process finishes. I'm thinking of Ansible and Terraform runs. I'd
rather not change to a different branch while ansible or Terraform are running as
I have no idea how those tools would behave (and I'm not too eager to find out).</p>
<p>In any case, Git Worktrees are here for the rescue:</p>
<h2 id="what-are-git-worktrees"><a class="header" href="#what-are-git-worktrees">What are git worktrees?</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree">Git Worktrees</a> allow you to have multiple
independent checkouts of your repository on different directories. You can have
multiple directories that correspond to different references in your repository.
Each worktree has it's independent working tree (duh) and index, so there is no
to run into conflicts. Changing to a different branch is just a <code>cd</code> away (if
the worktree is already set up).</p>
<h2 id="worktrees-in-grm"><a class="header" href="#worktrees-in-grm">Worktrees in GRM</a></h2>
<p>GRM exposes an opinionated way to use worktrees in your repositories. Opinionated,
because there is a single invariant that makes reasoning about your worktree
setup quite easy:</p>
<p><strong>The branch inside the worktree is always the same as the directory name of the worktree.</strong></p>
<p>In other words: If you're checking out branch <code>mybranch</code> into a new worktree, the
worktree directory will be named <code>mybranch</code>.</p>
<p>GRM can be used with both &quot;normal&quot; and worktree-enabled repositories. But note
that a single repository can be either the former or the latter. You'll have to
decide during the initial setup which way you want to go for that repository.</p>
<p>If you want to clone your repository in a worktree-enabled way, specify
<code>worktree_setup = true</code> for the repository in your <code>config.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[[trees.repos]]
name = &quot;git-repo-manager&quot;
worktree_setup = true
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when you run a <code>grm sync</code>, you'll notice that the directory of the repository
is empty! Well, not totally, there is a hidden directory called <code>.git-main-working-tree</code>.
This is where the repository actually &quot;lives&quot; (it's a bare checkout).</p>
<p>Note that there are few specific things you can configure for a certain
workspace.  This is all done in an optional <code>grm.toml</code> file right in the root
of the worktree. More on that later.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-new-worktree"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-worktree">Creating a new worktree</a></h3>
<p>To actually work, you'll first have to create a new worktree checkout. All
worktree-related commands are available as subcommands of <code>grm worktree</code> (or
<code>grm wt</code> for short):</p>
<pre><code>$ grm wt add mybranch
[✔] Worktree mybranch created
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see that there is now a directory called <code>mybranch</code> that contains a checkout
of your repository, using the branch <code>mybranch</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cd ./mybranch &amp;&amp; git status
On branch mybranch
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</code></pre>
<p>You can work in this repository as usual. Make changes, commit them, revert them,
whatever you're up to :)</p>
<p>Just note that you <em>should</em> not change the branch inside the worktree
directory.  There is nothing preventing you from doing so, but you will notice
that you'll run into problems when trying to remove a worktree (more on that
later). It may also lead to confusing behaviour, as there can be no two
worktrees that have the same branch checked out. So if you decide to use the
worktree setup, go all in, let <code>grm</code> manage your branches and bury <code>git branch</code>
(and <code>git checkout -b</code>).</p>
<p>You will notice that there is no tracking branch set up for the new branch. You
can of course set up one manually after creating the worktree, but there is an
easier way, using the <code>--track</code> flag during creation. Let's create another
worktree. Go back to the root of the repository, and run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ grm wt add mybranch2 --track origin/mybranch2
[✔] Worktree mybranch2 created
</code></pre>
<p>You'll see that this branch is now tracking <code>mybranch</code> on the <code>origin</code> remote:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ cd ./mybranch2 &amp;&amp; git status
On branch mybranch

Your branch is up to date with 'origin/mybranch2'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</code></pre>
<p>The behaviour of <code>--track</code> differs depending on the existence of the remote branch:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the remote branch already exists, <code>grm</code> uses it as the base of the new
local branch.</li>
<li>If the remote branch does not exist (as in our example), <code>grm</code> will create a
new remote tracking branch, using the default branch (either <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>)
as the base</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, you'll have a workflow that uses tracking branches by default. It would
be quite tedious to add <code>--track</code> every single time. Luckily, the <code>grm.toml</code> file
supports defaults for the tracking behaviour. See this for an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[track]
default = true
default_remote = &quot;origin&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This will set up a tracking branch on <code>origin</code> that has the same name as the local
branch.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you might want to have a certain prefix for all your tracking branches.
Maybe to prevent collissions with other contributors. You can simply set
<code>default_remote_prefix</code> in <code>grm.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[track]
default = true
default_remote = &quot;origin&quot;
default_remote_prefix = &quot;myname&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>When using branch <code>my-feature-branch</code>, the remote tracking branch would be
<code>origin/myname/my-feature-branch</code> in this case.</p>
<p>Note that <code>--track</code> overrides any configuration in <code>grm.toml</code>. If you want to
disable tracking, use <code>--no-track</code>.</p>
<h3 id="showing-the-status-of-your-worktrees"><a class="header" href="#showing-the-status-of-your-worktrees">Showing the status of your worktrees</a></h3>
<p>There is a handy little command that will show your an overview over all worktrees
in a repository, including their status (i.e. changes files). Just run the following
in the root of your repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ grm wt status
╭───────────┬────────┬──────────┬──────────────────╮
│ Worktree  ┆ Status ┆ Branch   ┆ Remote branch    │
╞═══════════╪════════╪══════════╪══════════════════╡
│ mybranch  ┆ ✔      ┆ mybranch ┆                  │
│ mybranch2 ┆ ✔      ┆ mybranch ┆ origin/mybranch2 │
╰───────────┴────────┴──────────┴──────────────────╯
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;Status&quot; column would show any uncommitted changes (new / modified / deleted
files) and the &quot;Remote branch&quot; would show differences to the remote branch (e.g.
if there are new pushes to the remote branch that are not yet incorporated into
your local branch).</p>
<h3 id="deleting-worktrees"><a class="header" href="#deleting-worktrees">Deleting worktrees</a></h3>
<p>If you're done with your worktrees, use <code>grm wt delete</code> to delete them. Let's
start with <code>mybranch2</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ grm wt delete mybranch2
[✔] Worktree mybranch2 deleted
</code></pre>
<p>Easy. On to <code>mybranch</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ grm wt delete mybranch
[!] Changes in worktree: No remote tracking branch for branch mybranch found. Refusing to delete
</code></pre>
<p>Hmmm. <code>grm</code> tells you:</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, there is no remote branch that you could have pushed
your changes to. I'd rather not delete work that you cannot recover.&quot;</p>
<p>Note that <code>grm</code> is very cautious here. As your repository will not be deleted,
you could still recover the commits via <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog"><code>git-reflog</code></a>.
But better safe then sorry! Note that you'd get a similar error message if your
worktree had any uncommitted files, for the same reason. Now you can either
commit &amp; push your changes, or your tell <code>grm</code> that you know what you're doing:</p>
<pre><code>$ grm wt delete mybranch --force
[✔] Worktree mybranch deleted
</code></pre>
<p>If you just want to delete all worktrees that do not contain any changes, you
can also use the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ grm wt clean
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this will not delete the default branch of the repository. It can of
course still be delete with <code>grm wt delete</code> if neccessary.</p>
<h3 id="persistent-branches"><a class="header" href="#persistent-branches">Persistent branches</a></h3>
<p>You most likely have a few branches that are &quot;special&quot;, that you don't want to
clean up and that are the usual target for feature branches to merge into. GRM
calls them &quot;persistent branches&quot; and treats them a bit differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their worktrees will never be deleted by <code>grm wt clean</code></li>
<li>If the branches in other worktrees are merged into them, they will be cleaned
up, even though they may not be in line with their upstream. Same goes for
<code>grm wt delete</code>, which will not require a <code>--force</code> flag. Note that of
course, actual changes in the worktree will still block an automatic cleanup!</li>
<li>As soon as you enable persistent branches, non-persistent branches will only
ever cleaned up when merged into a persistent branch.</li>
</ul>
<p>To elaborate: This is mostly relevant for a feature-branch workflow. Whenever a
feature branch is merged, it can usually be thrown away. As merging is usually
done on some remote code management platform (GitHub, GitLab, ...), this means
that you usually keep a branch around until it is merged into one of the &quot;main&quot;
branches (<code>master</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>develop</code>, ...)</p>
<p>Enable persistent branches by setting the following in the <code>grm.toml</code> in the
worktree root:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">persistent_branches = [
    &quot;master&quot;,
    &quot;develop&quot;,
]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that setting persistent branches will disable any detection of &quot;default&quot;
branches. The first entry will be considered your repositories' default branch.</p>
<h3 id="converting-an-existing-repository"><a class="header" href="#converting-an-existing-repository">Converting an existing repository</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to convert an existing directory to a worktree setup, using <code>grm wt convert</code>. This command has to be run in the root of the repository you want
to convert:</p>
<pre><code>grm wt convert
[✔] Conversion successful
</code></pre>
<p>This command will refuse to run if you have any changes in your repository.
Commit them and try again!</p>
<p>Afterwards, the directory is empty, as there are no worktrees checked out yet.
Now you can use the usual commands to set up worktrees.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-remotes"><a class="header" href="#working-with-remotes">Working with remotes</a></h3>
<p>To fetch all remote references from all remotes in a worktree setup, you can
use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>grm wt fetch
[✔] Fetched from all remotes
</code></pre>
<p>This is equivalent to running <code>git fetch --all</code> in any of the worktrees.</p>
<p>Often, you may want to pull all remote changes into your worktrees. For this,
use the <code>git pull</code> equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>grm wt pull
[✔] master: Done
[✔] my-cool-branch: Done
</code></pre>
<p>This will refuse when there are local changes, or if the branch cannot be fast
forwarded. If you want to rebase your local branches, use the <code>--rebase</code> switch:</p>
<pre><code>grm wt pull --rebase
[✔] master: Done
[✔] my-cool-branch: Done
</code></pre>
<p>This will rebase your changes onto the upstream branch. This is mainly helpful
for persistent branches that change on the remote side.</p>
<p>There is a similar rebase feature that rebases onto the <strong>default</strong> branch instead:</p>
<pre><code>grm wt rebase
[✔] master: Done
[✔] my-cool-branch: Done
</code></pre>
<p>This is super helpful for feature branches. If you want to incorporate changes
made on the remote branches, use <code>grm wt rebase</code> and all your branches will
be up to date. If you want to also update to remote tracking branches in one go,
use the <code>--pull</code> flag, and <code>--rebase</code> if you want to rebase instead of aborting
on non-fast-forwards:</p>
<pre><code>grm wt rebase --pull --rebase
[✔] master: Done
[✔] my-cool-branch: Done
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;So, what's the difference between <code>pull --rebase</code> and <code>rebase --pull</code>? Why the
hell is there a <code>--rebase</code> flag in the <code>rebase</code> command?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, it's kind of weird. Remember that <code>pull</code> only ever updates each worktree
to their remote branch, if possible. <code>rebase</code> rabases onto the <strong>default</strong> branch
instead. The switches to <code>rebase</code> are just convenience, so you do not have to
run two commands.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rebase --pull</code> is the same as <code>pull</code> &amp;&amp; <code>rebase</code></li>
<li><code>rebase --pull --rebase</code> is the same as <code>pull --rebase</code> &amp;&amp; <code>rebase</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I understand that the UX is not the most intuitive. If you can think of an
improvement, please let me know (e.g. via an GitHub issue)!</p>
<h3 id="manual-access"><a class="header" href="#manual-access">Manual access</a></h3>
<p>GRM isn't doing any magic, it's just git under the hood. If you need to have access
to the underlying git repository, you can always do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ git --git-dir ./.git-main-working-tree [...]

but it may help in a pinch.</p>
